# About Kromsys

> Kromsys was initially created by Sebastian Pennino back in the 2000s.
> 
> Around 2010, he formalized the idea by publishing it on a blog and also by 
> distributing a PDF (as well as some print copies) to his closest friends.
> It was a almost finished copy, around 90%.
> 
> Many years later, during a social gathering, he mentioned his frustration at 
> never having "properly finished" the system, and some friends volunteered to help out.
> 
> The Kromsys Team was formed, and we started working on our free time to finish it.
